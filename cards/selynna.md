# Happy birthday Max! 

Hey, it's the start of another year in your life, and the start of more amazing memories! It's been such a blast the last 3? years (damn, time has really flown) - meeting each other through Hack Camp, roadtripping to Idyllwild, teaching Hack Club workshops at hackathons, eating lots of amazing food, board games, and so much more. Even though we haven't seen each other too often recently, I have no doubt that we'll have more awesome times. :tada: 

Have the best birthday ever, you really deserve it! Let's meet up sometime this summer, and maybe I'll see you at SM Hacks this weekend. ILY MAX <3 <3 <3
