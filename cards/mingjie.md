# Happy birthday, Max! 🎈🍰
Small cake because all of us should eat healthy :)

Personally I would appreciate you for helping me on all those Hack Club related work - setting things up at midnight, raging over trolling services, and all that crazyness. You've contributed so much to the entire Hack Club community since the beginning, and there's more to come!!!!! 🙌

Wish you a great coming year! Stay healthy and work hard, but not too hard 😅... And I really hope I can come visit you guys at HQ some time soon!!!
