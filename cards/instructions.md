# What is this?

April 25 is [Max Wofford](https://maxwofford.com)'s birthday. We've created a special website for him! If you'd like to write him a birthday card, keep reading.

# Instructions

To create a card, you simply need to make a Markdown file. Decide on your author name first, whether it's your first name or username.

Then, you'll create a file titled with the author name you chose, and attach these lines to the beginning of the file:

    ---
    author: 'your author name'
    ---

When you've done that, just submit a PR and you're good to go!
